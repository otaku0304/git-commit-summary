## ✨ Features
*   **Rich UI**: Beautiful terminal output with colors and clear formatting.
*   **Smart Analysis**: 
    *   Tracks files changed and file types (e.g., .py, .js).
    *   Calculates net changes (Added vs Removed).
    *   Detects new functions across multiple languages (Python, JS, C++).
*   **Author Branding**: Displays author credentials and portfolio links.
*   **Security Focused**: Sanitized input handling and robust error management.
*   **No Heavy Dependencies**: Runs with standard library (uses `colorama` if available, falls back gracefully).

## 🔒 Security

This tool uses sterile input processing from stdin. It does not execute external code or shell commands, ensuring your local environment remains secure against injection attacks from malicious diffs.
